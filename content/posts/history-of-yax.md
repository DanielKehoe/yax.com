I registered the Yax.com domain name in 1996.

I was deep into a project and needed a short and memorable name to describe it. It was a geeky project and I gave it a name that was appropriately geeky.

There was a long tradition in computer science of using the "YA" or ["Yet Another" acronym in naming software projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yet_another), dating back to the early 1970s and Stephen C. Johnson's Unix parser Yacc (Yet Another Compiler-Compiler). So my project was "Yet Another" project attempting to build something others had already attempted. And the "X"? I've got a lousy background in mathematics but I knew from elementary algebra that the letter "x" represents an unknown. So with my Yax project, I had "Yet Another Unknown." Catchy, eh?

The project was an attempt to build software for collaborative documents on the web. With the technology that was available at the time, it seemed that the only way to implement the vision was to extend the HTML specification to accommodate document versioning. I was thinking about running "yax servers" that would deliver "yax documents" to "yax editor/browsers."

Originally I wanted to let people append notes and comments to the web pages they view. This was ten years before the “content editable” functionality was built into browsers, which became the foundation for a web-based word processor named Writely that was acquired and released by Google as Google Docs.

The very first web browser had the capability of editing as well as viewing web pages.
